# IoT-Based Heart Rate and SpO2 Tracker 
**An innovative IoT project to monitor health parameters in real time.** 

## Project Overview 
This project is designed to monitor **heart rate**, **SpO2 levels**, and **temperature** using: 
- **NodeMCU** for IoT connectivity
- **MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter** for heart rate and SpO2 monitoring
- **DHT11 Sensor** for temperature tracking
The data is transmitted to the **Blynk app** for real-time monitoring.
    
## Features 
- Accurate real-time health monitoring
- IoT integration for remote data visualization
- Compact and cost-effective setup

## Project Structure
- **/Code**: Contains the Arduino sketch file.
- **/Images**: Includes circuit diagrams and hardware setup photos.

## How It Works
1. Sensors collect heart rate, SpO2, and temperature data.
2. NodeMCU transmits the data to the **Blynk app** over Wi-Fi.
3. Users can monitor the health metrics on the app interface.
